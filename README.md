# Tweem

Because Twitter for Mac updated to v3.0.1 and it's ugly.

Requirements:

* `node-webkit` for your platform

OSX Requirements:

* [terminal notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier)
  for notifications (Native bridge between ObjC+node-webkit doesn't work)

## How to run

Launch application in the correct way for node-webkit. Everything is
stored in localStorage so nothing extra is needed.

## Issues

* Interactions won't load - This is because I'm going official first
* Can't tweet - Sorry :(
